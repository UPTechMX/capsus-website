        case_years: 2017-2018
        case_clients: World Bank Group and Korean Green Growth Trust Fund
        case_id: ph2
        case_content: "Through modeling urban scenarios, the Jordanian national government and local authorities in Amman, Irbid, Russeifa, Zarqa and Mafraq evaluated strategies and investments to drive long-term sustainable urban development in the country. The study compares different urban growth alternatives for the five cities. Through the study, the impact of different public policies on the environmental, social and economic aspects was quantitatively compared, informing decision makers and generating consensus on the policies that provide greater benefits. The project was developed with funds from the Korean Green Growth Trust Fund through the World Bank Group."

      - name: "Urban Growth Scenarios for Indonesia"
        case_locations: Denpasar, Semarang and Palu, Indonesia
        case_years: 2017-2018
        case_clients: World Bank Group, Korean Green Growth Trust Fund and National Government of Indonesia
        case_id: ph3
        case_content: "The Urban Growth Scenarios for Indonesia was funded by the Korean Green Growth Trust Fund through the World Bank Group to assess development paths for two Indonesian cities –Semarang and Denpasar. Urban growth scenarios were developed adapting two tools: Suitability and Urban Performance. The tools were used to visualize impacts of different public policies on the environmental, social and economic dimensions. The scenarios included different urban public policies in terms of housing availability, water efficiency, energy consumption, costs-revenues balance and greenhouse gases emissions, thus estimating environmental, social, and economic indicators for each urban growth path option. Additionally, the benefits and drawbacks of different combinations of public policies, projects and conditions were assessed to reach consensus about the best development path. Stakeholders participated in a series of capacity building and technology transfer workshops. Finally, as an extension for the project, we proposed new land regulations for Palu, after the 2018 earthquake and tsunami."
